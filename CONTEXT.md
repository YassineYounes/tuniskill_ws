## Technical Context

### Architecture Decisions

#### Backend: Symfony Framework
**Rationale for Symfony:**
- Mature and stable framework with long-term support
- Excellent performance and scalability characteristics
- Rich ecosystem of bundles and third-party integrations
- Strong security features and best practices
- Comprehensive testing capabilities
- Active community and extensive documentation

**Key Symfony Components:**
- **Doctrine ORM**: Database abstraction and entity management
- **Security Component**: Authentication, authorization, and CSRF protection
- **Serializer**: API response formatting and data transformation
- **Validator**: Input validation and data integrity
- **Messenger**: Asynchronous message handling for background tasks
- **Mailer**: Email notifications and communication

#### Frontend: Angular Framework
**Rationale for Angular:**
- Enterprise-grade framework with strong TypeScript support
- Comprehensive tooling and CLI for development efficiency
- Powerful reactive programming with RxJS
- Excellent testing capabilities with Jasmine and Karma
- Strong community and Google backing
- Suitable for large-scale applications

**Key Angular Features:**
- **Component Architecture**: Modular and reusable UI components
- **Services and Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Routing**: Single-page application navigation
- **HTTP Client**: API communication with interceptors
- **Forms**: Reactive and template-driven form handling
- **Angular Material**: Consistent UI component library

### Database Design Philosophy

#### Entity Relationship Overview
The database schema follows domain-driven design principles with clear entity boundaries:

**Core Entities:**
- **User**: Authentication and profile information
- **Course**: Course metadata, pricing, and structure
- **Lesson**: Individual learning units within courses
- **Enrollment**: User-course relationships and progress tracking
- **Payment**: Transaction records and billing information
- **Review**: Course ratings and feedback system

**Supporting Entities:**
- **Category**: Course categorization and taxonomy
- **Tag**: Flexible content labeling system
- **Certificate**: Completion credentials and achievements
- **Discussion**: Course forums and Q&A functionality

### API Design Principles

#### RESTful Architecture
The API follows REST principles with clear resource-based URLs:
- **GET /api/courses**: Retrieve course listings
- **POST /api/courses**: Create new course
- **GET /api/courses/{id}**: Retrieve specific course
- **PUT /api/courses/{id}**: Update course information
- **DELETE /api/courses/{id}**: Remove course

#### Response Format Standardization
All API responses follow a consistent structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "errors": [],
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {},
    "timestamp": "2024-08-09T06:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

#### Authentication Strategy
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) implementation with:
- Access tokens for API authentication (short-lived)
- Refresh tokens for session management (long-lived)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting and security headers

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

#### Component Hierarchy
```
AppComponent
├── HeaderComponent
├── NavigationComponent
├── RouterOutlet
│   ├── HomePageComponent
│   ├── CourseListComponent
│   ├── CourseDetailComponent
│   ├── UserProfileComponent
│   └── DashboardComponent
└── FooterComponent
```

#### State Management Strategy
- **Local Component State**: For simple UI interactions
- **Service-based State**: For shared data across components
- **RxJS Subjects**: For reactive data streams
- **Future Consideration**: NgRx for complex state management

#### Responsive Design Approach
- Mobile-first design philosophy
- Angular Flex Layout for responsive grids
- Angular Material breakpoints for device adaptation
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
